# TG-Pokemon-Search

This code is a Python script that performs a Pokémon search. The bot listens to the '/pokemon' command and expects a keyword as an argument either Pokémon ID on name after the command. It sends a request to Sugoi-API with the provided keyword and retrieves Pokémon. Bot then formats and sends the result back to the user in a text message with image of the Pokémon.
